## Description

I found this weird minecraft datapack that asks me for a password, can you help me find the right one?

PS the flag's format is `BtSCTF{<password>}` \
PS2 minecraft is _not_ required but it helps, to run it, create a new world, copy the `btsctf` directory to `saves/<world's name>/datapacks/`, run `/datapack enable "file/btsctf"` and then `/reload`
