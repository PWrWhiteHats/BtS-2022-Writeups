> Remember to submit flag in the correct format `BtSCTF{A-Za-z0-9_}`

## Flag

Check in the [flag.txt](flag.txt) file.

## How to run

To start a challenge you just need to download a file babyste. To prepare it run change_flag.py script. The file named babyste should appear.
The flag is not in a standard format, you need to change it manually to ascii letters.
