    Someone've sent me this website, which is used by scammers for their frauds. I think I might somehow hack them this way... Can you confirm? Let's show those puppets who is the boss!

    Take a long night hacking their own thing
    Be fighting them all night with all my friends
    Sitting on the shores of scammerland, oh
